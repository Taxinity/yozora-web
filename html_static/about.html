<h3>Yozora is the work of two student developers who wanted to create a better custom osu! server.</h3>
<h3>It is a fully featured, fast, and safe place to play. Your osu! account is safe when playing on our server.</h3> 
<h3>Unlike some, we aren't run by cheaters or have other motives for running the server.</h3>
<h3>We're actively developing new features and always listening to people's feedback.</h3>
